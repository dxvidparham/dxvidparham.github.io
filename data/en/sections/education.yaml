          My master's thesis focused on advancing autonomous outdoor navigation using innovative
          data-driven methodologies. By leveraging technologies like Lightweight OpenPose and
          ST-GCN, we achieved real-time analysis of video streams. Our work included successful
          implementation and testing, demonstrating feasibility in real-world scenarios.
          Additionally, we enhanced our system with gaze estimation and proximity measurement
          algorithms to improve robots' situational awareness and decision-making capabilities.

          In this scientific research project, I utilized advanced techniques, including
          Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN), to create realistic synthetic images.
          This approach aimed to supplement a limited training dataset by generating additional
          data points, enhancing the reliability of subsequent models while maintaining
          high classification accuracy.
